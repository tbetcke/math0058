    "Assuming you are working in single precision floating point arithmetic and you have a backward stable algorithm for a problem with condition number $\\kappa = 10^{3}$. How many correct digits do you expect in your solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is backward stable. Hence, the backward error is expected to be a small multiple of machine precision. We have $\\epsilon_{mach} \\approx 6\\times 10^{-8}$. The condition number is $10^3$. Hence, the forward error is expected to be a multiple of $10^{-5}$, giving us around 3 to 4 digits of accuracy in the solution depending on the pre-factors. "
